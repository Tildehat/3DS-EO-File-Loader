# EON-File-Loader
 Allows the loading modded files outside the HPB for Etrian Odyssey Nexus 

This is for specifically the North American Version of Etrian Odyssey Nexus.

Place modded files in the same directory as if the HPB was unpacked. This also allows files that are otherwise not inside the HPB to be loaded.

NOTE: If using with Citra files and directories need to be case sensitive. If your modded files are not loading please check casing. This also breaks if you are running the game unpacked...but if you're running the game unpacked you don't need this patch.
